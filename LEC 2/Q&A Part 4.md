1. Why use Go?
 Go allows you to concentrate on distributed systems problems
    good support for concurrency
    good support for RPC
    garbage-collected (no use after freeing problems)
    type safe
  We like programming in Go
    simple language to learn
    a fashionable language when we redid the 6.824 labs

  share memory, use pc, register, stack
  more than cores
  challenges: sharing data, coordination between threads, granularity of concurrency

3. Exercise  Done(in part 3)

4. RPC
