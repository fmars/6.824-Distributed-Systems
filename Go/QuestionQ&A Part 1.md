Write down questions and answers we have before reading paper implementation. Basically try to come up with a idea what if we are about to build such a system

Couple years I ago, I learnt C++. One year ago I leannt Python. Until worked on some real project two years ago, I didn't realize how functional lanuange can benefit testing, developing. People call Python as semi-functional language. I got that sense at some degree. But some question was kept in my mind about if there is no class, how to handle stateful data in a grace way.

Now I'm learning Go, a real functional language. When I took the first glance of method and receiver, I was suprised by the talend of Go designer. However when I rethought about it, I feel confused. Except for syntax difference to define a method, putting receiver after 'def' or before 'def', what's the essential difference between this functional language and non-functional ones. It still has class(struct), and can define methods upon it.
