# Learn-Distributed-Systems

## Context
I found MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems is an fantastic course provided by MIT. It covers major components in Distributed Systems, such as MapReduce, GFS, ZooKeeper, etc. It also focuses on critical topics, such as fault tolerance, replication, consistency, etc. It picks several milestone papers as part of the course material. More surprisingly, the course lecture helps to explore critical questions in the paper and share understandings. I found some of the summarization are very insightful, from a industrial perspective.

## How will we use this
- Record the questions and answers we have during paper reading
- Record what we learnt and discovered from each lecture in the course
- Create a platform to better communicate and discuss interesting topics between @fmars and @mumu
- Hope to bring some value to the community and help others who may find this helpful

## More details
- We create a folder for each lecture
- For each paper we want to write down questions we have before reading lecture
- For each lecture we want to write down the pearls we found 
- For each extra material, such as Go tutorial, we create a separate space for discussion
- Create per lab disucssion thread
