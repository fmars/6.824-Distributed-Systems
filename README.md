# Learn-Distributed-Systems
## Context
The course we're following is [MIT 6.824: Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html). Here is the [course schedule](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html).


## Motivation
I found MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems is an fantastic course provided by MIT. It covers major components in Distributed Systems, such as MapReduce, GFS, ZooKeeper, etc. It also focuses on critical topics, such as fault tolerance, replication, consistency, etc. It picks several milestone papers as part of the course material. More surprisingly, the course lecture helps to explore critical questions in the paper and share understandings. I found some of the summarization are very insightful, from a industrial perspective.

## How will we use this
- Record the questions and answers we have during paper reading
- Record what we learnt and discovered from each lecture in the course
- Create a platform to better communicate and discuss interesting topics between @fmars and @mumu
- Hope to bring some value to the community and help others who may find this helpful

## More details
- We create a folder for each lecture
- For each paper we want to write down questions and answers we have before reading paper implementation. Basically try to come up with some idea what if we build such a system
- For each paper we want to write down questions and answers we have before reading lecture material. Basically point out the interesting topics we want to discuss, and the elegant design we noticed.
- For each paper we want to write down what we think after reading lecture material
- For each lecture we want to write down the pearls we found 
- For each extra material, such as Go tutorial, we create a separate space for discussion
- Create per lab disucssion thread
